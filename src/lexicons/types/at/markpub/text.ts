Facets select their character ranges based on position in the Markdown text but should be rendered without the related characters. For example: `### Header` will be selected using a character range that includes the hashes like (0,9) but will be rendered without the hashes like `<h3>Header</h3>`. It is recommended that processors to not transform in-place for this reason.
